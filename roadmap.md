- you have finished your arabic layout using the ANSI template
switch to the ISO template just to see how it looks.  
The reason is that arabic speakers in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa all would normally use ISO keyboards.  ANSI keyboards are normal in the US, S. America, ad Asia (except in Japan which uses JIS)
