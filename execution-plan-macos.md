### Refined Execution Plan: Building a Custom Colemak Arabic Layout for macOS

**1. Define Requirements and Scope:**
   - Clearly outline the specific Arabic characters and diacritics you want to include in the layout.
   - Set a clear scope for the project, including any special characters or symbols.

**2. Set Up Development Environment:**
   - Ensure that your macOS system is set up for development.
   - Verify that you have administrative privileges to install and modify keyboard layouts.

**3. Research Existing Colemak Layouts for macOS:**
   - Explore existing Colemak layouts for macOS to identify potential base layouts.
   - Analyze their structure and mappings to inform your design decisions.

**4. Detailed Arabic Character Mapping:**
   - Create a detailed mapping document that associates each Arabic character with its corresponding Colemak position.
   - Include mappings for diacritics and any additional characters.

**5. Evaluate Ergonomics:**
   - Analyze the ergonomic implications of your layout.
   - Ensure that frequently used characters are placed in comfortable positions to minimize finger movement.

**6. Test on a Subset:**
   - Initially, focus on mapping a subset of Arabic characters for testing purposes.
   - Use this subset to evaluate the practicality of your layout and make early refinements.

**7. Prototype in Ukelele:**
   - Begin the layout design in Ukelele, starting with the subset of characters.
   - Utilize Ukelele's visual interface to create and visualize key mappings.

**8. Iterative Design and Testing:**
   - Implement the full Arabic character set in Ukelele, iterating and testing at each step.
   - Test the layout in simulated typing scenarios to identify any discomfort or inefficiencies.

**9. Handle Diacritics and Special Characters:**
   - Implement mappings for diacritics and any special characters.
   - Ensure that the layout remains intuitive and comfortable.

**10. Version Control:**
   - Implement version control for your Ukelele project file.
   - Regularly commit changes to facilitate collaboration and version tracking.

**11. Collaboration and Feedback:**
   - Share your work with the community or interested individuals.
   - Encourage feedback and collaboration to enhance the layout.

**12. Documentation:**
   - Create comprehensive documentation for your custom layout.
   - Include installation instructions, key mappings, and any considerations for users.

**13. Continuous Improvement:**
   - Continue refining the layout based on user feedback.
   - Address any reported issues promptly and release updates as needed.

**14. Finalization and Distribution:**
   - Finalize the layout based on user feedback and your own testing.
   - Distribute the final version, ensuring clear instructions for installation.

**15. User Support:**
   - Provide ongoing support for users who adopt your custom layout.
   - Establish a communication channel for users to report issues and seek assistance.
